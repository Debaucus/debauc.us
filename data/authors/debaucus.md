I am Debaucus.

I build projects that interest me, with a focus on building communities to help other communities grow. I've found that the passionate projects you work on are the ones that turn out the best. If you do it for fun and it can self-sustain you.. why not?!

With the recent projects I am aiming to learn and improve my skillset to achieve a higher degree of professional output. I want to be able to not just make my projects work for me, but for others who use them.

Should you wish to contact me, Discord and Telegram are my current go-to messaging apps.
