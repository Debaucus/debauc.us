# Customised and cleaned.

This project is based on [Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog](https://GitHub.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog/) which is an awesome base point to get started, but I felt it could be changed and updated in order to provide a better base for a beginner, who might not want to deal with some of the major factors you only need for a larger or growing project.

# Changes made

- Updated to NextJS 13 and the required dependancies for it.
- Ability to host via [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), a free hosting platform on the Cloudflare edge network.
- Custom Image Loader/Optimiser. Allows for images to be hosted locally/on Github.
- Reduced bloat. Only Card styles remain for posts. Newsletter removed. Additional analytics removed.
- Index Filters. Ability to show projects base on a filter of a tag. One line change to customise.

# Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) blogging starter template. Probably the most feature-rich Next.js markdown blogging template out there. Comes out of the box configured with the latest technologies to make technical writing a breeze. Easily configurable and customizable. Perfect as a replacement to existing Jekyll and Hugo individual blogs.

## Sample posts

## Quick Start Guide

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
npm run dev
```

To test the default build of Cloudflare Pages with NextJS static. Use the following:

```bash
npm run cloud
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Extend / Customize

`data/siteMetadata.js` - contains most of the site related information which should be modified for a user's need.

`data/authors/default.md` - default author information (required). Additional authors can be added as files in `data/authors`.

`data/headerNavLinks.js` - navigation links.

`data/logo.svg` - replace with your own logo.

`data/blog` - replace with your own blog posts.

`public/static` - store assets such as images and favicons.

`tailwind.config.js` and `css/tailwind.css` - contain the tailwind stylesheet which can be modified to change the overall look and feel of the site.

`css/prism.css` - controls the styles associated with the code blocks. Feel free to customize it and use your preferred prismjs theme e.g. [prism themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes).

`components/social-icons` - to add other icons, simply copy an svg file from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) and map them in `index.js`. Other icons use [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/).

`components/MDXComponents.js` - pass your own JSX code or React component by specifying it over here. You can then call them directly in the `.mdx` or `.md` file. By default, a custom link and image component is passed.

`layouts` - main templates used in pages.

`pages` - pages to route to. Read the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) for more information.

`next.config.js` - configuration related to Next.js. You need to adapt the Content Security Policy if you want to load scripts, images etc. from other domains.
